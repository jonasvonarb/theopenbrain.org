More formally, does vision work via intromission (eg. light passing into the eyes) or extramission (eg. energy passing out of the eyes). Many of the earliest theories favored the extramission model of vision. <span id='alcmeon' class='hoverImg'>Alcmeon</span> (Greece, 5<span class='superscirpt'>th</span> century BCE), thought of the eye as a lantern, emitting an internally generated fire that was required for seeing<sup data-sup='1'>1</sup>. <span id='plato' class='hoverImg'>Plato</span> and others would evolve this theory to incorporate both an internally generated visual fire that leaves the eye, as well as spirits emanating from objects, with these two energies interacting before returning to the eye to enable vision<sup data-sup='1'>1</sup>. As an outcome of this idea, Plato argued that we dream during sleep when this internal fire collides with our closed eyelids and bounces back into our body."

The Hippocratic school split the eye into 3 layers (or tunics) based on gross anatomy: sclera, uvea, and retina. Since then, a much clearer picture has emerged. The external part of the eye is comprised of 2 main parts: the cornea, a clear crystalline material, and the sclera, a white fibrous layer. Moving inwards from the sclera is the choroid, a layer important for vascularization, the retinal pigment epithelium, a layer important for its complex interactions with photoreceptors, and the retina. Aside from these structures, there is a lens near the front half of the eye, whose shape can be adjusted by the ciliary muscles to change the focus of incoming image on the retina. There are also 2 fluid filled chambers, the anterior and posterior chambers, that contain aqueous and vitreous humour, respectively<sup data-sup='3'>3</sup>. These fluids maintain pressure in the eye and circulate important nutrients. Impairments in the exchange of these fluids can lead to increases in intraocular pressure which are associated with ocular health issues, such as glaucoma<sup data-sup='3'>3</sup>."

The cornea provides more refractive power to the eye than the lens, and this can be witnessed if you open your eyes under water, as water and the cornea have similar refractive indices. Importantly, the curvature of the cornea is stronger in its center compared to its periphery, which helps it act like a corrected spherical lens to ensure incoming light rays are brought to a common focus<sup data-sup='4'>4</sup>. Light then passes through the aqueous humor, and some photons make their way through the pinhole in the center of the iris, which is the pupil. Pigment in the iris gives us our ‘eye colour’. Changes in luminance result in alternations in pupil size (dilated in dim light, constricted in bright light – outlined in more detail below). Light then passes through the lens, which has a graded index to help focus rays entering various parts of the lens onto the same location of the retina<sup data-sup='4'>4</sup>. Importantly, the thickness of the lens can be adjusted depending on the distance between the eye and the object being viewed, to appropriately focus the image on the retinal surface<sup data-sup='3'>3</sup>.

Cell bodies of neurons in the vertebrate retina are grouped into 3 distinct layers, separated by 2 synaptic layers. Light passes through the entire retina before being focused on the deepest (i.e. closest to the back of the eye) layer of the retina, where specialized photon detectors called photoreceptors reside. These neurons contain opsins that absorb photons and transduce their energy into electric signals. Photoreceptors extend nerve terminals into a synaptic layer called the outer plexiform layer where they synapse with bipolar and horizontal cells, whose cell bodies, along with those of amacrine cells, reside in the inner nuclear layer. Bipolar cells relay signals from photoreceptors to the inner plexiform layer where they synapse with amacrine and retinal ganglion cells. Ganglion cell somata occupy the ganglion cell layer, which abuts the vitreous humour. Axons from all ganglion cells get bundled together into the optic nerve, which ‘dives’ back through the entire retina before leaving the eye, resulting in a small blind spot in each eye’s field of view (as the location of the optic nerve head contains no photoreceptors). Finally, as light must pass through the entire retina in order to reach photoreceptors, it is sometimes said that the retina is organized in an ‘upside down’ or inverted manner. This is true for the entire retina except for the fovea – a cone-dense region in the center of the macula that subserves our high visual acuity vision. Within the fovea, the rest of the retina is ‘pushed aside’, such that light does not have to pass through any retinal layers (or any vasculature) before reaching the cones."

The consequences of this arrangement are two-fold: first, the nearest neighbors of a given retinal neuron belong to different types of cells (except for photoreceptors which do not have dendrites and thus have very small receptive fields); Second, the dendrites of same-type neighbours minimally overlap, resulting in a given cell type tiling the retina (and visual field) with minimal redundancy. While mosaics are a general principle in lateral organization of the retina, this does not mean that spacing between neurons is fixed across the entire retina.

They are long thin cells with a soma situated in the outer nuclear layer, a nerve terminal located in the outer plexiform layer, and an elongated outer segment with opsin-filled disks extending towards the retina pigment epithelium. Each outer segment contains roughly 1000 membranous disks arranged like a stack of coins. Each disk is densely packed with molecules of photopigment-filled opsins and their associated phototransduction machinery. This disc organization is critical for photoreceptor function because it amplifies photoreceptor surface area by ~1000-fold, greatly increasing the number of light-catching opsin molecules within a single photoreceptor<sup data-sup='38'>38</sup>. A thin stalk connects the opsin-filled outer segment with the mitochondria-rich inner segment, which helps sustain the tremendous energy costs of phototransduction<sup data-sup='10'>10</sup>. Vertebrate photoreceptors can be morphologically divided into 2 classes based on the shape of their outer segments. Cone photoreceptors exhibit tapered outer segments (i.e. their outer segment is shaped like a cone), are specialized to detect photons during daylight conditions, and possess various opsin variants that make them sensitive to photons of different wavelengths. Humans have 3 cone types, with maximal photon absorptions situated in the blue (peak excitation ~420 nm), green (peak excitation ~534 nm) and red (peak excitation ~564 nm) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In contrast to cones, rods have long (rod-shaped) outer segments, and are specialized for detecting photons in dim environments<sup data-sup='10'>10</sup>. Discs in rod outer segments contain rhodopsin molecules attuned to wavelengths in the center of the visible range (blue-green; peak excitation ~498 nm). Rhodopsin is more densely concentrated in rod outer segments than cone-opsins are in cone outer segments. Additionally, in rods, the disks in the outer segment are wholly internal to the cell’s outer membrane, whereas in cones the outer membrane invaginates multiple times in the outer segment and itself contains the opsin molecules. The disks have a lifespan of roughly 12 days, after which time they are shed at the outer segment’s tip and phagocytosed by the surrounding retinal pigment epithelium. In turn, new disks are added at the base of the outer segment."

The star’s brightness at the corneal surface is ~2800 photons/sec/mm<sup data-sup='2'>2</sup>, and like a windowpane the cornea transmits most of this light, though some (~2.5%) is reflected away. About 9% of the photons that pass through the cornea are absorbed by the anterior compartment, and the remainder (2350 photons/sec/mm<sup data-sup='2'>2</sup>) reach the pupil. Since it is a very dark night, your pupil is fully dilated (~40mm<sup data-sup='2'>2</sup>), allowing roughly 94,000 visible photons to pass through the iris and lens every second. More than half (~57%) of these 94,000 photons are absorbed by the vitreous humour before arriving at the retina. Due to ongoing eye movements, different small patches of retina see the starlight every 100ms or so. In this short time window, ~1100 photons strike a given retinal patch containing ~120 photoreceptors, meaning that ~9 photons enter each photoreceptor.

In a world of ever-changing light levels, the photoreceptor needs to detect photons, and convert them into an electrical signal that regulates its release of glutamate. Complicating this task, the driving force through the cGMP-gated channels changes as the photoreceptors membrane potential dynamically depolarizes and hyperpolarizes. This might be expected to lead to different photoresponses to an equivalent visual stimulus depending on the history of what the photoreceptor just saw. Fortunately, the photoreceptor can effectively ‘count photons’, without strongly being impacted by previous photons. How? Plotting the current that flows through a rod cGMP-gated channel across different membrane voltages reveals a strong rectification: photocurrents are relatively fixed across negative membrane potentials (where the photoreceptor generally operates)<sup data-sup='28'>28</sup>.

If we consider signal and noise, it becomes clear why small currents are better in this situation. Channel opening is subject to thermodynamic noise. As a consequence, cGMP-channels in photoreceptors are frequently flickering between open and closed states. If the single channel current was very large, these flickering events could lead to large variations in the cell’s membrane potential, which could incorrectly be interpreted by the organism as photons that were detected. Thus, the retina’s strategy divides ‘thermal noise’ across many channels, each with very small currents. The noise of different channels is independent, and thus is averaged out.

A key solution our brains use is to focus processing power on local differences in the incoming image, such as edges or local motion. This process occurs in two ways: first, ethologically important features are specifically encoded by the visual system (this is discussed in detail in Section 6 below); second, information processing is actively minimized in parts of the visual field that show high redundancy, via center-surround mechanisms.  Center-surround antagonism begins at the first synapse of the visual pathway, where it is implemented by horizontal cells. Each horizontal cell contacts many photoreceptors with its dendrites and/or axons, and responds to photoreceptor glutamate release via ionotropic glutamate receptors in its dendrites.

As such, a small visual stimulus that only activates a small number of cones, such as a star in the sky, evokes little horizontal cell feedback. In contrast, a large visual stimulus that activates many adjacent cones, such as a cloudless blue sky, evokes significant horizontal cell feedback.

Thus, when photoreceptors are releasing high levels of glutamate in the dark, glutamate binds to mGluR6 and closes TRPM1 channels, which hyperpolarizes ON bipolar cells. Increments in light intensity lower glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft, which releases the inhibition of TRPM1 by mGluR6, driving a depolarizing inward current, thereby activating ON bipolar cells. As such, ON bipolar cells are described as being able to ‘sign-invert’ the photoreceptor light response (i.e. when photoreceptors hyperpolarize, ON bipolar cells depolarize). Mutations within the G protein pathway in ON bipolar cells can result in congenital stationary night blindness, because rod signals are passed through a type of ON bipolar cell called a rod bipolar cell (described in more detail in Section 6 below). ON bipolar cell axons make synapses with amacrine and ganglion cells in the half of the inner plexiform layer, closest to the ganglion cell layer.

Most bipolar cells (at least those outside of the fovea), receive input from multiple photoreceptors, and within their receptive field center integrate inputs linearly across space. For example, if we imagine that each bipolar cell center sums the input from 10 photoreceptors, then a light pattern falling on the bipolar cell receptive field that darkens 5 of these photoreceptors from a baseline level (glutamate increase) and brightens the other 5 (glutamate decrease), does not lead to a change in bipolar cell membrane potential, as globally its dendrites do not experience a change in glutamate concentration. Linear responses at this level of the retinal circuit mean that bipolar cells signal the mean luminance over all their connected photoreceptors, rather than encoding the spatial organization of the incoming stimulus. However, in reality things are a bit more complicated, as like photoreceptors, bipolar cells also have inhibitory receptive field surrounds, meaning that what is presented outside their receptive field center can modulate their response to what is shown in their receptive field center."

Center responses are driven by excitatory bipolar cell input which is collected over a ganglion cell’s dendritic tree. Surround responses are driven predominantly by horizontal cells providing surround inhibition in the outer retina, and by GABAergic amacrine cells that reside (laterally) further away and relay visual signals to the central ganglion cell. Center bipolar cells, and the bipolar cells that activate amacrine in the surround, are driven by the same luminance change. Varying the luminance delivered to center vs. surround changes the relative mix of excitatory (bipolar) or inhibitory (amacrine) drive to a central ganglion cell. For example, in an ON ganglion cell, a bright spot placed in the surround activates amacrine cell inhibition and antagonizes the excitatory effects of a center spot that drives bipolar cells. A bright spot placed in the surround of this neuron evokes only amacrine inhibition and does not drive spikes. A dark spot placed in the surround inhibits the amacrine cell and reduces inhibition to the ganglion cell; such disinhibition can lead ganglion cells to spike."

Instead, firing rate represents a relative increase or decrease from the mean luminance. In fact, a given ganglion cell is only able to reliably signal increases in a spot’s intensity over about two orders of magnitude. However, through various mechanisms, the retina as a whole is able to adapt to the mean luminance of a given environment, meaning that the luminance response curve of a ganglion cell can shift depending on mean luminance, allowing us to see over roughly 10 orders of magnitude. However, light adaptation is not instantaneous, and can account for why it might take a minute for your retina to adjust when you pass between two environments with significantly different mean luminance levels (like walking from a dark room into a sunny environment)."

The neural retina represents a part of the CNS that is conveniently located outside the skull, making it “an approachable part of the brain” that has proven to be a powerful model for the field of developmental biology."

These are still early days, but soon many patients will be receiving some restored visual capabilities. This is remarkable, but we must keep in mind that often this restored vision will be highly attenuated, or in other ways quite different than normal retinal vision. We must therefore strive to understand the extent to which we can (or need to) restore normal retinal vision, and how various forms of restoration lead to different degrees of visual competency and patient satisfaction."
