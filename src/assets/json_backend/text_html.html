<p>: Refraction Errors: Despite our body&rsquo;s best laid plans, a variety of developmental and age-related issues can cause our eyes to improperly focus incoming images onto the retina, resulting in impaired vision. Two common issues result from the image being focused either in front of (myopia) or behind (hyperopia) the retina. Myopia, also commonly referred to as nearsightedness, blurs images of far-away images. In contrast, hyperopia, commonly referred to as farsightedness, blurs images of nearby images. Another common refractive issue is astigmatism, which results in uneven focus of the incoming image on the retina, due to irregular curvature of the cornea or lens abnormalities. Finally, as we age, the lens becomes less elastic and the ciliary muscles become less effective at accommodating different focal planes, leading to presbyopia, which tends to focus images behind the retina. In general, most types of refractive errors can be addressed with corrective lenses.

<p style="margin-right: 0.2pt; text-align: justify">
  For the purposes of this chapter, we define <em>classes</em> as a
    high-level category, and retinal neurons are split into 5: photoreceptors,
    horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, ganglion cells. In turn, we
    define <em>types&nbsp;</em>as a low-level category, as each class can be
    split into a number of cell types (e.g. different types of photoreceptors).
    Within a given class of retinal neurons, different cell types serve unique
    functional roles. Evidence for this division of cell classes into subtypes
    was evident from the earliest anatomical studies on the retina: for
    instance, drawings of photoreceptors by the anatomist Max Schultz showed
    cells with two distinct morphologies, revealing rods and cones<sup>1</sup>. More recent work has shown that distinct retinal cell types can be
    distinguished from one another by gene expression profiles, connectivity
    patterns, morphology and functional response properties<sup>17&ndash;27</sup>. Furthermore, for a given cell type there appears to be a strong
    correlation between each of these metrics. Below, we briefly introduce the
    different retinal classes and discuss them in greater detail later in the
    chapter.</span

    types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, and that each was differentially
    localized in the retina and served different functions. Anatomical work from
    Max Schultze indicated that cones were mostly located near the center of the
    human retina, whereas rods dominated in the periphery<sup>1</sup>. Behavioral work from Hermann Aubert showed that visual acuity and colour
    discrimination both decreased from the center to the periphery of the visual

    input from bipolar cells and in turn inhibit bipolar, ganglion and other
    amacrine cells. In some vertebrate species, amacrine cells comprise more
    than 50 different cell types, each exhibiting a unique anatomy, physiology,
    and gene expression profile<sup>5</sup>. While some amacrine cells exhibit distinct dendrites and an axon, many
    have processes that act as both pre and postsynaptic elements. Attempts to
    generalize are difficult in the face of this diversity, however some trends
    have been observed: first, almost all amacrine cells are inhibitory neurons
    releasing either GABA or glycine onto their targets; Second, glycinergic
    amacrine cells tend to have narrow dendritic trees, and thus small receptive
    fields, whereas GABAergic cells tend to have broader dendritic trees and
    thus larger receptive fields<sup>30</sup>; Third, many amacrine cells release an additional neurotransmitter, which
    can be excitatory, but is more commonly a neuromodulator such as a peptide
    or catecholamine<sup>5,6</sup>.

  Photoreceptors are the most evolutionary ancient part of the retina, and
    likely evolved from ciliated sensory cells that blanketed the skin of our
    early submarine ancestors<sup>35&ndash;38</sup>. They are long thin cells with a soma situated in the outer nuclear layer,
    a nerve terminal located in the outer plexiform layer, and an elongated
    outer segment with opsin-filled disks extending towards the retina pigment
    epithelium. Each outer segment contains roughly 1000 membranous disks
    arranged like a stack of coins. Each disk is densely packed with molecules
    of photopigment-filled opsins and their associated phototransduction
    machinery. This disc organization is critical for photoreceptor function
    because it amplifies photoreceptor surface area by ~1000-fold, greatly
    increasing the number of light-catching opsin molecules within a single
    photoreceptor<sup>39</sup>. A thin stalk connects the opsin-filled outer segment with the
    mitochondria-rich inner segment, which helps sustain the tremendous energy
    costs of phototransduction<sup>10,29</sup>. Vertebrate photoreceptors can be morphologically divided into 2 classes
    based on the shape of their outer segments. Cone photoreceptors exhibit
    tapered outer segments (i.e. their outer segment is shaped like a cone), are
    specialized to detect photons during daylight conditions, and possess
    various opsin variants that make them sensitive to photons of different
    wavelengths. Humans have 3 cone types, with maximal photon absorptions
    situated in the blue (peak excitation ~420 nm), green (peak excitation ~534
    nm) and red (peak excitation ~564 nm) regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum. In contrast to cones, rods have long (rod-shaped) outer segments,
    and are specialized for detecting photons in dim environments<sup>10,29</sup>. Discs in rod outer segments contain rhodopsin molecules attuned to
    wavelengths in the center of the visible range (blue-green; peak excitation
    ~498 nm). Rhodopsin is more densely concentrated in rod outer segments than
    cone-opsins are in cone outer segments. Additionally, in rods, the disks in
    the outer segment are wholly internal to the cell&rsquo;s outer membrane,
    whereas in cones the outer membrane invaginates multiple times in the outer
    segment and itself contains the opsin molecules. The disks have a lifespan
    of roughly 12 days, after which time they are shed at the outer
    segment&rsquo;s tip and phagocytosed by the surrounding retinal pigment
    epithelium. In turn, new disks are added at the base of the outer
    segment.</span

  Stars, like our sun, emit energy along various parts of the electromagnetic
    (EM) spectrum. In fact, most of the photons we encounter in the world are
    outside our visible range&nbsp;</span
  >&mdash;</span
  >&nbsp;the vast majority of these are in the infrared: they create a warm
    sensation when absorbed by our skin, but we cannot see them. Visible photons
    occupy a narrow band of the EM spectrum, and interestingly, are among a
    subset of photons that best penetrate sea water &ndash; where a large family
    of opsins evolved over millions of years<sup>35,36</sup>. Below, we discuss how these &lsquo;visible&rsquo; photons are detected by
    photoreceptors in the retina and get converted into electrical
    signals.&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0.2pt; text-align: justify">
  The eye and retina act as a camera and film, designed to collect incoming
    photons. Catching photons is hard since they move fast and because so many
    are lost on the trip from the surface of the eye to the retina. To
    illustrate this point, we describe a thought experiment initially put
    forward by Bob Rodieck<sup>10</sup>: Imagine you are camping, peering up at the North Star in the night sky.
    The star&rsquo;s brightness at the corneal surface is ~2800
    photons/sec/mm<sup>2</sup>, and like a windowpane the cornea transmits most
    of this light, though some (~2.5%) is reflected away. About 9% of the
    photons that pass through the cornea are absorbed by the anterior
    compartment, and the remainder (2350 photons/sec/mm<sup>2</sup>) reach the
    pupil. Since it is a very dark night, your pupil is fully dilated
    (~40mm<sup>2</sup>), allowing roughly 94,000 visible photons to pass through
    the iris and lens every second. More than half (~57%) of these 94,000
    photons are absorbed by the vitreous humour before arriving at the retina.
    Due to ongoing eye movements, different small patches of retina see the
    starlight every 100ms or so. In this short time window, ~1100 photons strike
    a given retinal patch containing ~120 photoreceptors, meaning that ~9
    photons enter each photoreceptor. Converting this weak signal into the clear
    perception of the North Star is the job of the phototransduction
    machinery.<sup>28</sup>

  >&nbsp;In the mid-1870s, Franz Boll identified a substance in the frog
    retina that bleached when exposed to light&nbsp;</span
  >&mdash;</span
  >&nbsp;it became known as &ldquo;visual purple&rdquo; or rhodopsin and is
    the light sensing protein in rod photoreceptors<sup>40,41</sup>. Rhodopsin contains the opsin retinal, which is synthesized from vitamin
    A<sup>29,41</sup>. Even as far back as ancient Egypt, the Ebers medical papyrus dating from
    ~1500 BCE recommended treating night blindness with liver (which happens to
    be high in vitamin A, though the ancient Egyptians recommended topically
    applying liquid from the liver directly to the eye)<sup>1</sup>. The bleaching that Boll had observed was the result of retinal undergoing
    a photoisomerization from 11-cis to all-trans retinal. This isomerization
    triggers conformational changes in rhodopsin, which initiates a signal
    transduction cascade. Subtle amino-acid variations in the structure of the
    opsin change the way 11-cis retinal is &lsquo;held&rsquo; within the
    rhodopsin molecule, and alter the photon wavelength required for a
    photoisomerzation event<sup>29,41,42</sup>. This is a core difference between opsins that detect blue, green, and red
    photons (such as those in cones). The conversion is remarkably efficient,
    with approximately 2/3 of absorbed photons resulting in a
    photoisomerization<sup>41</sup>. By comparison, this quantum efficiency is only 1/10 for photographic
    film.</span

    concentration of the small molecule cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate),
    which tonically activates cGMP-gated cationic channels. This results in
    Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow in the outer segment, which
    balances an ongoing efflux of K<sup>+</sup> ions in the inner segment. This
    ionic flux results in a relatively depolarized resting membrane potential
    (Vm) of ~-30mV in darkness. Rhodopsin is a G-protein coupled receptor. It
    becomes enzymatically active following photon absorption and in turn
    activates the G-protein transducin. Transducin is composed of&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Symbol">a</span
  >,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Symbol">b</span
  >, and&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Symbol">g</span
  >&nbsp;subunits, and upon activation, releases its&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Symbol">bg</span
  >&nbsp;subunit. Its&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Symbol">a</span
  >&nbsp;subunit in turn activates a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that then
    hydrolyzes cGMP molecules. The resulting decrease in intracellular [cGMP] in
    the outer segment leads to the closure of cGMP-gated cation channels<sup>28</sup>. Since the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> ions continues in the inner segment,
    closing cGMP-gated channels in the outer segment results in photoreceptor
    membrane hyperpolarization, leading to a decrease in glutamate release. This
    light-evoked hyperpolarization is called a photovoltage, and its amplitude
    and duration depend on the luminance, size and duration of the light flash.
    Finally, an activated rhodopsin molecule needs to be de-activated, otherwise
    the phototransduction cascade would continue endlessly. Phototransduction
    terminates when an activated rhodopsin is phosphorylated by a membrane-bound
    enzyme called rhodopsin kinase. The addition of a phosphate to rhodopsin
    leads to its binding by a protein called arrestin, which ejects the
    rhodopsin kinase, and quenches rhodopsin&rsquo;s ability to activate
    transducin by breaking the bond between all-trans retinal and opsin<sup>28,29,42</sup>.</span>

  <u>3.1.2&nbsp;</span></u
  >Counting photons: The photoreceptor is given a difficult task. In a world
    of ever-changing light levels, the photoreceptor needs to detect photons,
    and convert them into an electrical signal that regulates its release of
    glutamate. Complicating this task, the driving force through the cGMP-gated
    channels changes as the photoreceptors membrane potential dynamically
    depolarizes and hyperpolarizes. This might be expected to lead to different
    photoresponses to an equivalent visual stimulus depending on the history of
    what the photoreceptor just saw. Fortunately, the photoreceptor can
    effectively &lsquo;count photons&rsquo;, without strongly being impacted by
    previous photons. How? Plotting the current that flows through a rod
    cGMP-gated channel across different membrane voltages reveals a strong
    rectification: photocurrents are relatively fixed across negative membrane
    potentials (where the photoreceptor generally operates)<sup>28</sup>. This rectification helps make the photovoltage proportional to the flash
    intensity that evoked it, rather than also being dependent on the history of
    prior flashes.</span

  >&nbsp;cGMP-channels are abundant in photoreceptors<sup>28</sup>. Each can drive a very small current, about 3fA. &nbsp;This single channel
    current is extremely small (most channels pass currents about 3 orders of
    magnitude greater). Why not use a larger single channel current for
    signaling photon absorption? If we consider signal and noise, it becomes
    clear why small currents are better in this situation. Channel opening is
    subject to thermodynamic noise. As a consequence, cGMP-channels in
    photoreceptors are frequently flickering between open and closed states. If
    the single channel current was very large, these flickering events could
    lead to large variations in the cell&rsquo;s membrane potential, which could
    incorrectly be interpreted by the organism as photons that were detected.
    Thus, the retina&rsquo;s strategy divides &lsquo;thermal noise&rsquo; across
    many channels, each with very small currents. The noise of different
    channels is independent, and thus is averaged out. In contrast, the signal
    (i.e. the detection of photons produced by a flash of light) is synchronized
    across channels and photoreceptors, and is averaged in.&nbsp;</span

    takes place. First, the activated rhodopsin activates ~700 transducin
    molecules, which in turn activate ~700 phosphodiesterase molecules (in other
    words, each PDE activates 1 transducin). This results in the degradation of
    ~1400 cGMP molecules, leading to the closure of ~230 cGMP-gated channels

  >: When rhodopsin absorbs a photon, its light-catching 11-cis retinal
    chromophore is isomerized into all-trans retinal. This latter form cannot be
    used for photon absorption, and the retina undertakes a complex series of
    steps to convert all-trans retinal back to photo-activatable 11-cis retinal.
    Following binding of arrestin, the bond between all-trans retinal and the
    opsin is broken. The all-trans aldehyde is released and quickly converted to
    all-trans retinol by membrane bound retinal dehydrogenase, which is in turn
    bound by an all-trans retinol binding protein. From here, a transport
    protein called interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) takes
    all-trans retinol on an inter-cellular journey into the retina pigment
    epithelium, which intercalates with photoreceptor outer segments. The retina
    pigment epithelium contains a pair of enzymes&nbsp;</span

    and 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase which uses ATP to convert 11-cis retinol

    and is quickly bound by an IRBP which encapsulates the molecule, which makes
    the return trip out of retina pigment epithelium and back into the
    photoreceptor outer segment, where it is released and binds anew with an

  >&nbsp;Rods are more sensitive to photons than cones<sup>28,43</sup>. Part of the reason lies in their relatively greater opsin content
    compared to their cone counterparts<sup>28,29</sup>. Another part of the answer lies in different isoforms of the
    phototransduction machinery<sup>43</sup>. Briefly, the phototransduction isoforms expressed in rods lead them to
    break down cGMP more rapidly, leading to a higher photon response gain in
    rods than in cones<sup>43</sup>. Another part of the answer comes from lower levels of GTPase‐accelerating
    proteins in rods &ndash; these proteins increase the rate at which
    transducin hydrolyses GTP and becomes inactive. These differences permit
    rods to detect a greater number of photons (higher opsin concentration),
    turn on transduction machinery more quickly, and stay active for
    longer.&nbsp;</span

  The increased sensitivity of rods incurs two principal costs:
    responsiveness and bleaching. Because rods are so much more sensitive than
    cones (up to 1000x in the human retina), it also means that quick changes in
    illumination are likely to be &lsquo;smoothed&rsquo; out<sup>44</sup>. Rods also tend to run out of 11-cis retinal more quickly than their cone
    counterparts under sustained illumination, which prevents them from sensing
    any additional photons. However, this difference also occurs because cones
    possess an intrinsic ability to isomerize all-trans retinal back into its
    light-sensing 11-cis isoform.</span

  The visual world contains a tremendous amount of redundancy. Take a look at
    the room you are sitting in while you read this text, or look at the border
    between the land and sky if you happen to be outside or near a window.
    Encoding any portion of the visual world is costly to the brain, so it is
    advantageous to limit the encoding of redundant parts of the visual world. A
    key solution our brains use is to focus processing power on local
    differences in the incoming image, such as edges or local motion. This
    process occurs in two ways: first, ethologically important features are
    specifically encoded by the visual system (this is discussed in detail in
    Section 6 below); second, information processing is actively minimized in
    parts of the visual field that show high redundancy, via center-surround
    mechanisms. &nbsp;Center-surround antagonism begins at the first synapse of
    the visual pathway, where it is implemented by horizontal cells. Each
    horizontal cell contacts many photoreceptors with its dendrites and/or
    axons, and responds to photoreceptor glutamate release via ionotropic
    glutamate receptors in its dendrites. Paired recordings from photoreceptors
    and horizontal cells revealed that injecting hyperpolarizing current into a
    horizontal cell causes a depolarization in the photoreceptor<sup>45</sup>.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0.2pt; text-align: justify">
  Glutamate released from a single photoreceptor has a very small effect on a
    horizontal cell&rsquo;s membrane potential, whereas when multiple
    neighbouring photoreceptors signal in tandem, this has a significant effect
    on the horizontal cell. Furthermore, horizontal cells are densely
    interconnected with one another via gap junctions, enabling them to
    efficiently pool signals when a visual stimulus is large and relatively
    homogeneous. As such, a small visual stimulus that only activates a small
    number of cones, such as a star in the sky, evokes little horizontal cell
    feedback. In contrast, a large visual stimulus that activates many adjacent
    cones, such as a cloudless blue sky, evokes significant horizontal cell
    feedback. While this surround feedback effect is well described, its
    mechanism remains controversial, and may rely on a combination of chemical
    synapses, ephaptic and pH related mechanisms.&nbsp;</span

  Bipolar cells receive signals from photoreceptors and deliver them to
    neurons of the inner retina. While photoreceptors all respond similarly when
    activated by a photon of light (i.e. they hyperpolarize), bipolar cells come
    in a variety of different types, which allow distinct bipolar cells to
    respond differentially to the same signal emanating from photoreceptors. In
    primates, midget bipolar cells are thought to synapse with individual
    photoreceptors in the fovea and relay their signals onto individual retinal

    profile<sup>20,46</sup>, whether they depolarize to increases or decreases in luminance, and how
    their responses vary to visual stimuli flickered at various temporal

    luminance, this machinery permits photoreceptors to tonically release
    glutamate into the synaptic cleft, and enables the photoreceptor to encode
    both increases in luminance (resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and a
    decrease in glutamate release), as well as decreases in luminance (resulting
    in membrane depolarization and an increase in glutamate release). OFF
    bipolar cell dendrites respond to photoreceptor-released glutamate with
    ionotropic AMPA and Kainate type glutamate receptors. These receptors are
    non-selective cation channels that pass inward currents upon binding
    glutamate. Thus, OFF bipolar cells hyperpolarize to a flash of light and
    depolarize following a decrease in luminance (responding similarly to the
    photoreceptors, in a &lsquo;sign-conserving&rsquo; manner). OFF bipolar cell
    axons make synapses with amacrine and ganglion cells in the half of the

  >&nbsp;Unlike OFF bipolar cells, which possess ionotropic glutamate
    receptors in their dendrites, ON bipolar cell dendrites express a unique
    metabotropic glutamate receptor: mGluR6<sup>48,49</sup>. When bound to glutamate, these receptors activate an intracellular G
    protein pathway, leading to the closure of a non-selective cation
    channel&nbsp;</span
  >&mdash;</span
  >&nbsp;TRPM1<sup>29,50</sup>. Thus, when photoreceptors are releasing high levels of glutamate in the
    dark, glutamate binds to mGluR6 and closes TRPM1 channels, which
    hyperpolarizes ON bipolar cells. Increments in light intensity lower
    glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft, which releases the inhibition of
    TRPM1 by mGluR6, driving a depolarizing inward current, thereby activating
    ON bipolar cells. As such, ON bipolar cells are described as being able to
    &lsquo;sign-invert&rsquo; the photoreceptor light response (i.e. when
    photoreceptors hyperpolarize, ON bipolar cells depolarize). Mutations within
    the G protein pathway in ON bipolar cells can result in congenital
    stationary night blindness, because rod signals are passed through a type of
    ON bipolar cell called a rod bipolar cell (described in more detail in
    Section 6 below). ON bipolar cell axons make synapses with amacrine and
    ganglion cells in the half of the inner plexiform layer, closest to the
    ganglion cell layer. Much of the pioneering work, showing different axonal
    lamination patterns for ON and OFF channels in the retina, was led by Helga

      >Bipolar cells encode luminance, not patterns.</span
    ></u
  >&nbsp;The synaptic ribbons employed at photoreceptor-to-bipolar cell
    synapses lead to a relatively linear relationship between stimulus intensity
    and glutamate release, resulting in linear bipolar cell responses<sup>51</sup>. Most bipolar cells (at least those outside of the fovea), receive input
    from multiple photoreceptors, and within their receptive field center
    integrate inputs linearly across space. For example, if we imagine that each
    bipolar cell center sums the input from 10 photoreceptors, then a light
    pattern falling on the bipolar cell receptive field that darkens 5 of these
    photoreceptors from a baseline level (glutamate increase) and brightens the
    other 5 (glutamate decrease), does not lead to a change in bipolar cell
    membrane potential, as globally its dendrites do not experience a change in
    glutamate concentration. Linear responses at this level of the retinal
    circuit mean that bipolar cells signal the mean luminance over all their
    connected photoreceptors, rather than encoding the spatial organization of
    the incoming stimulus. However, in reality things are a bit more
    complicated, as like photoreceptors, bipolar cells also have inhibitory
    receptive field surrounds, meaning that what is presented outside their
    receptive field center can modulate their response to what is shown in their
    receptive field center.</span

  >&nbsp;Aside from splitting the visual world into ON and OFF components,
    bipolar cells also sort temporal aspects of the incoming visual scene<sup>52,53</sup>. For instance, some bipolar cell types respond transiently to an abrupt
    change in light intensity and are optimized for encoding fast changes in
    luminance over there receptive fields, whereas others respond in a sustained
    manner to changes in light intensity and are optimized to encode the mean
    luminance over their receptive fields. These different
    &lsquo;interpretations&rsquo; of the incoming stimulus appear to be partly
    cell-intrinsic, relying on different synaptic receptors and membrane
    channels. The kinetically distinct bipolar cell signals can be used by
    downstream amacrine and ganglion cells for feature-detecting computations,

  >&nbsp;Much like photoreceptors, bipolar cell axon terminals possess
    synaptic ribbons that help with continuous neurotransmitter release.
    However, unlike photoreceptor terminals which release glutamate in a manner
    that is linearly related to stimulus intensity, many bipolar cell
    &lsquo;rectify&rsquo; the luminance signal<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;(i.e. they regulate the amount of glutamate released mainly in
    response to either light increments (in the case of ON bipolar cells) or
    light decrements (in the case of OFF bipolar cells)). For example, the
    change in glutamate release from an ON bipolar cell is far greater for a
    stimulus that is twice as bright as the background intensity than for a
    stimulus that is half as dim as the background intensity. The opposite is
    true for OFF bipolar cells. Such rectified bipolar cell output helps
    downstream ganglion cells become sensitive to patterns within their

    of action potentials. The retina sends out many different channels of visual
    content to the brain, each carrying distinct information about the incoming
    visual scene, with some channels focused on motion, others on colour, others
    on size, etc<sup>17,31</sup>. It appears that roughly 15 visual channels leave the primate retina<sup>56</sup>. These channels are represented by different types of ganglion cells<sup>6,17,46</sup>. While ganglion cells are the focus of this section, their response
    properties are intertwined with the amacrine cells they are connected to, so
    here we discuss both cell types in combination. Furthermore, while some
    amacrine cells fire action potentials, and some bipolar cells can generate
    spike-like events, ganglion cells are generally considered the predominant
    spiking cell in the retina. Another important property of ganglion cells is
    that many of them can independently relay inputs that arise in a portion of
    their receptive field&nbsp;</span

    the bipolar cell section, we outlined how bipolar cells are unable to
    distinguish between a grey background and a stimulus that half-illuminates
    and half-darkens their receptive field. It turns out that some ganglion
    cells can respond to such stimuli, encoding both ON and OFF inputs. Such
    processing in ganglion cells is referred to as a non-linearity&nbsp;<sup>57,58</sup>. This property enhances a ganglion cell&rsquo;s ability to encode patterns
    within its receptive field. Below, we outline several canonical circuit

    Subsequently, in the 1950s Horace Barlow and Steven Kuffler found that
    ganglion cell receptive fields could be divided into 2 parts: the center and
    the surround<sup>60,61</sup>. In these studies, a spot of light was placed at several positions
    relative to a ganglion cell&rsquo;s soma. At positions within a circular
    region close to the cell body (the center), the spot caused the neuron to
    fire. Spots placed in position beyond this center region (the surround)
    caused no firing (or even a decrease from the baseline firing rate). This
    surrounding region was also somewhat circular in shape and placing a spot in
    this region simultaneously with a spot in the center produced less firing
    than when a spot was placed in the center alone. Similar results were
    obtained for both ON and OFF types of ganglion cells.&nbsp;</span

  Work over the following decades would reveal the circuitry underlying
    center and surround mechanisms. Center responses are driven by excitatory
    bipolar cell input which is collected over a ganglion cell&rsquo;s dendritic
    tree. Surround responses are driven predominantly by horizontal cells
    providing surround inhibition in the outer retina, and by GABAergic amacrine
    cells that reside (laterally) further away and relay visual signals to the
    central ganglion cell. Center bipolar cells, and the bipolar cells that
    activate amacrine in the surround, are driven by the same luminance change.
    Varying the luminance delivered to center vs. surround changes the relative
    mix of excitatory (bipolar) or inhibitory (amacrine) drive to a central
    ganglion cell. For example, in an ON ganglion cell, a bright spot placed in
    the surround activates amacrine cell inhibition and antagonizes the
    excitatory effects of a center spot that drives bipolar cells. A bright spot
    placed in the surround of this neuron evokes only amacrine inhibition and
    does not drive spikes. A dark spot placed in the surround inhibits the
    amacrine cell and reduces inhibition to the ganglion cell; such
    disinhibition can lead ganglion cells to spike.</span

  Bob Rodieck modelled excitatory (center) and inhibitory (surround) portions
    of the receptive field with two Gaussians, which offered great power in
    predicting ganglion cell responses to light<sup>62,63</sup>. It also showed that a given ganglion cell encodes an edge (or small
    spot), and not a homogenous patch of visual space. Rodieck&rsquo;s models
    also made predictions about how center-surround organization could be used
    by downstream brain regions. For example, if a neuron in such a region has
    access to multiple center-surround receptive fields from several
    neighbouring ganglion cells, the precise location of a visual stimulus or
    pattern could be easily decoded. The most common cell types in the human

    split along red-green<sup>66</sup>&nbsp;and blue-yellow<sup>67</sup>&nbsp;axes. Red-green opponency is thought to be computed in midget

  >&nbsp;Colour Blindness. One of the first written accounts of colour
    blindness comes from John Dalton, of atomic theory fame, at the end of the
    18<sup>th</sup> century. He noted that he and his brother were colour blind,
    and he assembled a small list of other colour blind people. Most happened to
    be males. Dalton hypothesized that his vitreous humour was tinted blue, and
    thus absorbed longer wavelengths<sup>72</sup>. He donated his eyes upon his death, but no pigment abnormalities were
    found with his vitreous humour nor his lens. It is now known that colour
    vision starts with the 3 different types of cones (blue, green and red, as
    outlined above). It turns out that about 8% of males are red-green colour
    blind, due to a genetic mutation leading to dysfunction of either red or
    green cones. Other types of colour blindness exist, but are more rare. In
    the 1990s, genetic analysis of Dalton&rsquo;s preserved eye tissue revealed
    that he was missing functional middle wavelength (green) cones<sup>72</sup>. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: 'Calibri', sans-serif"

      >6.1.3 Direction selectivity</span
    ></em
  >: In the human and non-human primate visual system, it was generally
    thought that direction selective responses first arise in primary visual
    cortex. However, recent research has described direction selectivity in the
    primate retina<sup>73,74</sup>. This puts the primate retina in line with several animal models commonly
    studied, such as rabbits, mice and fish, where direction selectivity (DS)
    arises in retinal ganglion cells<sup>75</sup>, and where the circuitry underlying the DS computation is among the most
    studied in neuroscience. Early ideas came out of studies in insects and
    proposed that visual inputs from two spatially-offset locations were relayed
    to a single downstream neuron with differing delays<sup>76</sup>. A moving object that activated the long-delay input before the short
    delay input would drive neurons better since the delay allowed excitation
    from both locations to coincide. Motion in the opposite direction led to
    little coincidence, and so the neuron would respond selectively to motion
    direction. In contrast, retinal direction selectivity in mammals arises in
    ganglion cells primarily through direction-selective GABAergic inhibition
    from starburst amacrine cells<sup>75</sup>. These amacrine cells grow dendrites radially outwards from their cell
    bodies<sup>77</sup>. Starburst amacrine cells are preferentially activated by visual stimuli
    moving centripetally along their dendritic tree (i.e. moving away from the
    soma)<sup>78</sup>. The distal tip of each starburst dendrite connects with a ganglion cell.
    This ganglion cell in turn has the opposite preferred direction to that of
    its presynaptic starburst partner, since the amacrine cell releases GABA
    when activated<sup>79</sup>. In a remarkable feat of wiring, ganglion cells preferring a particular
    direction of motion receive inhibition exclusively from starburst amacrine
    cells dendrites that point the opposite (null) direction<sup>80</sup>. As such, stimuli moving in a ganglion cell&rsquo;s preferred direction
    drive very little inhibition, whereas stimuli moving in the ganglion
    cell&rsquo;s null direction drive strong GABAergic inhibition, which vetoes
    the relatively symmetrical excitatory drive from bipolar cells during both
    preferred and null direction motion.&nbsp;</span

  At least in the mouse and rabbit retina, there are several types of

    encoding motion along the cardinal axes (up, down, left and right). These

    ></em
  >&nbsp;An important task of the visual system is to separate object from
    background. An early correlate of this computation is thought to arise in
    the retina, with some ganglion cells preferentially responding when a small
    stimulus located in the receptive field center (i.e. the
    &lsquo;object&rsquo;) moves asynchronously from the stimulus impinging in
    its surround (i.e. the &lsquo;background&rsquo;)<sup>84</sup>. These cells have been described as &ldquo;fly detectors&rdquo;<sup>85</sup>, &ldquo;local edge detectors<sup>86</sup>&rdquo; and &ldquo;object motion sensitive&rdquo; cells<sup>87</sup>. Their properties arise because center excitation gets cancelled out by
    surround inhibition during synchronous center-surround motion<sup
    >84,87&ndash;89</sup>. Ensuring that surround inhibition is able to cancel out center excitation
    during such synchronous motion requires special circuitry, since signals in
    the center have to only travel through a bipolar cell to reach the ganglion
    cell, whereas surround motion signals must travel through a bipolar cell and
    an amacrine cell. Center bipolar excitation is slowed down by several
    mechanisms including interactions with glutamatergic amacrine cells and
    intrinsic properties. Surround inhibition is sped up by using an amacrine
    cell that can fire action potentials. The effect is that this ganglion cell
    preferentially responds when the stimulus in its center moves asynchronously
    from the stimulus in its surround, which has been suggested to be a method
    of computing object motion.</span

  Rod and cone mediated visual signals take different anatomical routes to
    arrive at retinal ganglion cells. Cones contact ON and OFF cone bipolar
    cells, which then directly contact ON and OFF ganglion cells
    respectively<sup>7</sup>. In contrast, rods predominantly contact rod bipolar cells (which are a
    type of ON bipolar cell)<sup>6</sup>. However, rod bipolar cells do not form synapses with ganglion cells<sup>90,91</sup>. Instead, rod bipolar cells make glutamatergic synapses with AII
    (pronounced A-2) amacrine cells<sup>6,91,92</sup>. AII amacrine cells pass rod signals to ON bipolars via electrical
    synapses, and OFF bipolars via glycinergic synapses<sup>34</sup>. Additionally, some rod responses get into the cone system via electrical

<p style="margin-right: 0.2pt; text-align: justify">
  Classically, the retina was considered to have 2 types of photoreceptors:
    rod and cones. However, around the turn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century,
    converging lines of evidence revealed that there was a population of
    ganglion cells that were themselves photosensitive<sup>93,94</sup>. Termed intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs),
    these cells contain melanopsin and can convert light into spiking responses
    in the absence of inputs from rod and cone circuits. ipRGCs project to
    several &lsquo;non-image forming&rsquo; visual centers in the brain, where
    their inputs are important for controlling circadian rhythm and the
    pupillary light reflex<sup>31,93,94</sup>. Interestingly, ipRGCs generally also receive light-evoked inputs from rod
    and cone pathways, and thus represent a hybrid visual signalling
    channel.</span

  While the axons of all retinal ganglion cells get bundled together and
    leave the eye via the optic nerve, each type of ganglion cells projects its
    axons to specific target regions in the brain. The most common
    retino-recipient targets are the LGN (which in turn projects to visual
    cortex which is responsible for conscious visual perception) and the
    superior colliculus (which is integral for controlling eye movements and
    integrating vision with other sensory inputs). Intrinsically photosensitive
    ganglion cells project to a host of other brain regions. In mice recent work

    a limited range of luminance change about a mean in their membrane
    potential. At the level of ganglion cells, this means that a given ganglion

    Instead, firing rate represents a relative increase or decrease from the
    mean luminance. In fact, a given ganglion cell is only able to reliably
    signal increases in a spot&rsquo;s intensity over about two orders of
    magnitude. However, through various mechanisms, the retina as a whole is
    able to adapt to the mean luminance of a given environment, meaning that the
    luminance response curve of a ganglion cell can shift depending on mean
    luminance, allowing us to see over roughly 10 orders of magnitude. However,
    light adaptation is not instantaneous, and can account for why it might take
    a minute for your retina to adjust when you pass between two environments
    with significantly different mean luminance levels (like walking from a dark
    room into a sunny environment).<span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: 'Calibri', sans-serif"

    living organisms with incredible detail, providing critical insights into
    how such an &ldquo;inimitable&rdquo; structure is formed. The retina begins
    as the optic vesicle, which buds off the embryonic diencephalon. A series of
    events take place whereby this nascent eye generates an eye-cup, lens, blood
    vessels, and retina. The neural retina represents a part of the CNS that is
    conveniently located outside the skull, making it &ldquo;an approachable

  >&nbsp;In rodents, a group of neuroblasts compose a sheet at the back
    surface of the growing eye cup. These cells have an I-beam shape when viewed
    in cross section, with anchors at the outer and inner margins of the
    developing retina. The nuclei within these cells undergo interkinetic
    migration, shuttling between the inner and outer margins of the retina,
    during which time they also generate daughter cells that will go on to
    become the various retinal classes. Retinal ganglion cells and amacrine
    cells are born first, bipolar cells next, and photoreceptors last. Current
    evidence indicates that within a neuron class, each subtype is generated
    randomly&nbsp;</span
  >&mdash;</span
  >&nbsp;for instance, neuroblasts generating only direction selective
    ganglion cells have not been found<sup>104</sup>. The generation of different neuronal classes happens over a range of
    days, and newly generated neurons must migrate to their final positions. The
    temporal delay in generation of different neuronal classes complicates the
    retinal wiring process, as the dendrites and axons of synaptic partners
    arrive asynchronously in the plexiform layers. To solve this problem, the
    retina relies on a stereotyped set of genetically defined adhesive cues that
    guide retinal circuit assembly<sup>105</sup>.&nbsp;</span>

    showed that the mechanisms driving these waves change over the course of
    development<sup

    given ganglion cell is only closely correlated with that of its nearest
    neighbors, but not with distantly located ganglion cells in the same retina
    or ganglion cells from the other eye. These waves of retinal activity
    propagate to retino-recipient areas in the brain, where this patterned
    activity is important for the development of retinotopic maps.

  <u>9.1 Cataracts</span></u>

<p style="margin-right: 0.2pt; text-align: justify">
  A cataract arises when the lens becomes cloudy<sup>3</sup>. Cataracts occur relatively commonly as humans age, though they can also
    have genetic or lifestyle-related causes (e.g. smoking, extended sun
    exposure, etc.). The extent of visual impairment caused by cataracts is wide
    ranging, from mild to completely obstructing the ability to focus images on
    the retina. Left untreated, it is a progressive issue. Cataracts can also
    arise in children, and if left untreated for extended periods of time
    (especially if present throughout the critical period), can affect vision
    even once removed. The first cataract surgical procedures were documented by
    Sushruta in India around 600 BCE (in which the lens was pushed out of the
    way, so as not affect incoming light), and the first documented cataract
    removal procedure was performed by Ammar, working in Egypt around 1000 CE.
    Currently, the standard protocol is to replace the cataract with an
    artificial lens, or simply remove the lens. Both approaches eliminate
    accommodation, but artificial lenses can be multifocal, to help account for
    this.</span

    photoreceptors can then be injected into the retina where the hope is that
    they will survive and form normal connections within the retina, thus
    restoring light sensitivity. Another approach could be to grow full retina

    the organoid.</span

  9.6.3 Retinal prostheses are electronic chips that are implanted in the
