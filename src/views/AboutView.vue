          <h2>The Project</h2>
          <p>
            theopenbrain.org is an Open Access neuroscience textbook. While we
            currently only have one chapter online, we are actively seeking
            funding in order to expand the book with many more chapters covering
            the breadth of neuroscience topics. Stay tuned for more!

          <p>
            The present copy of the Psalms, adorned with beauty of capital
            letters and sufficiently picked out with rubrics, has thus been
            fashioned by an ingenious method of printing and stamping without
            any driving of the pen, and to the worship of God has been
            diligently completed by Johannes Fust, citizen of Mainz, and Peter
            Schoeffer of Gernsheym, in the year of the Lord 1457 on the Vigil of
            the Assumption [i.e., August 14].
